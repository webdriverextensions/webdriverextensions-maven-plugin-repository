WebDriver Extensions Maven Plugin Repository 3.0
===================
This is the home of the drivers repository used by the [WebDriver Extensions Maven Plugin](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-maven-plugin) for version 1.X.X and and 3.X.X and later.

## Want to add a driver version to the repo?
Simply just fork this repo, add the driver info in the [repository-3.0.json](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-maven-plugin-repository/blob/master/repository-3.0.json) file and do a PR. 
No need to add the drivers to repository.json since that repo is no longer maintained.

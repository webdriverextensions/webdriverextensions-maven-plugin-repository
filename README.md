WebDriver Extensions Maven Plugin Repository 3.0
===================
This is the home of the drivers repository used by the [WebDriver Extensions Maven Plugin](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-maven-plugin) for version 1.X.X and and 3.X.X and later.

## Want to add a driver version to the repo?
Simply just fork this repo, add the driver info in the [repository-3.0.json](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-maven-plugin-repository/blob/master/repository-3.0.json) file and do a PR. 
No need to add the drivers to repository.json since that repo is no longer maintained.

### Where to find drivers?
- chromedriver: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
- geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
- edgedriver: https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
- operadriver: https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases

### How does an entry of a driver look like?
The repository JSON must be validated against [the driver schema](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-maven-plugin/blob/master/drivers-schema.json). Each driver entry is an object with the following properties (*the ones in bold are required*).

- **`name`**: the name of the driver. one of "chromedriver", "edgedriver", "geckodriver", "internetexplorerdriver", "operadriver" or "phantomjs"
- **`platform`**: the operating system. one of "linux", "windows" or "mac"
- **`bit`**: "64" for 64-bit or "32" for 32-bit
- **`version`**: the actual version of the driver
- **`url`**: the URL where the driver can be downloaded. compressed files and archives of the following types are supported: `.gz`, `.bz`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz`, `.zip`
- `arch`: driver os/cpu architecture. one of "x86", "amd64", "aarch64" or "ia64"
- `fileMatchInside`: a regular expression to select only the files that match the specified pattern
- `customFileName`: a custom name for the driver file in the installation directory

**Example**
```json
{
    "name": "edgedriver",
    "platform": "windows",
    "bit": "64",
    "arch": "amd64",
    "version": "108.0.1462.38",
    "fileMatchInside": "^msedgedriver\\.exe$",
    "url": "https://msedgedriver.microsoft.com/108.0.1462.38/edgedriver_win64.zip"
}
```

#### A note about the `arch` property
If there is only one variant of a driver for a given platform and bit, the property can be omitted.

If there is more than one variant of a driver for a certain platform and bit, e.g. edgedriver for Windows 64-bit and the architectures "amd64" and "aarch64" (M1), then both entries must contain the `arch` property and the "amd64" variant must be first!

**Example**
```json
{
...
	{
	    "name": "edgedriver",
	    "platform": "windows",
	    "bit": "64",
	    "arch": "amd64",
	    "version": "108.0.1462.38",
	    "fileMatchInside": "^msedgedriver\\.exe$",
	    "url": "https://msedgedriver.microsoft.com/108.0.1462.38/edgedriver_win64.zip"
	},
	{
	    "name": "edgedriver",
	    "platform": "windows",
	    "bit": "64",
	    "arch": "aarch64",
	    "version": "108.0.1462.38",
	    "fileMatchInside": "^msedgedriver\\.exe$",
	    "url": "https://msedgedriver.microsoft.com/108.0.1462.42/edgedriver_arm64.zip"
	}
...
}
```
